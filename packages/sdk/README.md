# @openchamber/sdk

Build extensions for [OpenChamber](https://openchamber.dev). An extension is a small web page that OpenChamber shows on its right-hand rail. It can read the current project and session, show toasts, put text in the chat box, attach a task to a session, and, once the user approves it, start sessions and send prompts. This package is the contract between that page and the app.

Full guide: [Build an extension](https://openchamber.dev/docs/sdk/). Reference: [Host API](https://openchamber.dev/docs/sdk/host/) and [UI kit](https://openchamber.dev/docs/sdk/ui/). Extensions with a local process: [GUEST_SERVICES.md](./GUEST_SERVICES.md).

Extensions load in OpenChamber web and desktop. VS Code and mobile do not load them yet.

## Install

```bash
npm install @openchamber/sdk
```

The package ships compiled JavaScript with type declarations, so any bundler works. Its version matches the OpenChamber release it shipped with, so `@openchamber/sdk@1.24.0` is the contract of OpenChamber 1.24.0.

## What you ship

A folder with three files:

- `package.json` with an `openchamber` block (the manifest)
- `panel/index.html`, the page OpenChamber shows
- `panel/main.js`, your script built into one classic file (an IIFE; the page runs in a sandboxed iframe and cannot load ES modules)

OpenChamber never compiles your code. Build `panel/main.js` yourself. The package includes a bundler command that runs on Bun; esbuild with `--format=iife --platform=browser` does the same job.

```bash
bunx openchamber-guest-bundle panel/main.ts panel/main.js
```

Then install the folder from Settings → Extensions → Add. Folder installs run from your folder, so edit, rebuild, and reload. A `.zip` or an https git or zip link is copied into OpenChamber's data folder instead; ship the built files only. Git installs can update from Settings → Extensions when the repository's `version` is newer than the installed one, so bump `version` to ship an update; `https://…/panel.git#v1` pins a tag or branch.

A complete three-file example is on the [Build an extension](https://openchamber.dev/docs/sdk/) page. Five more are at [github.com/openchamber/openchamber/tree/main/packages/sdk/examples](https://github.com/openchamber/openchamber/tree/main/packages/sdk/examples).

## Manifest

```json
{
  "name": "@acme/hello",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "openchamber": {
    "apiVersion": 1,
    "engines": { "openchamber": ">=1.24.0" },
    "contributes": {
      "panel": {
        "id": "acme-hello",
        "name": "Hello",
        "icon": "window",
        "entry": "panel/index.html"
      },
      "attach": "dialog",
      "capabilities": ["prompt", "sessions"],
      "actions": [
        { "id": "create-task", "label": "Create task from message", "where": "message", "roles": ["assistant"] },
        { "id": "summarize", "label": "Summarize session", "where": "session", "payload": ["messages"] }
      ],
      "commands": [{ "name": "task", "description": "Attach a task by id" }],
      "tools": [{ "match": "mcp.tasks.*", "name": "Tasks", "icon": "checkbox-circle", "title": "{input.id}", "output": "table", "columns": ["id", "title", "status"] }],
      "integration": {
        "name": "Acme",
        "description": "Tasks from Acme",
        "token": {
          "apiOrigin": "https://api.acme.example",
          "account": { "path": "/me", "name": "login" },
          "scheme": "bearer"
        },
        "settings": [{ "id": "list-id", "label": "List ID" }]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

- `version` is required semver. Settings → Extensions shows it on the card.
- `apiVersion` is `1`. Anything else is refused.
- `engines.openchamber` is optional (`1.24.0` or `>=1.24.0`). Older OpenChamber builds refuse the install.
- `panel.id` is kebab-case and unique. `icon` is a Remixicon name (`RiWindowLine` becomes `window`) or an SVG inside the folder. `entry` is the HTML file inside the folder. Leave `entry` out for an extension that only declares `tools`: it gets no rail icon or page, just its tool rules in the chat (`examples/tools-only`).
- `attach` is optional. `"dialog"` opens the page in a window from the + menu next to the chat box; `true` or `"panel"` opens the rail panel instead. `ctx.surface` tells the page which one it is in. The object form `{ "mode": "dialog", "entry": "panel/attach.html" }` gives the window its own page. When the user clicks the attached chip, the page opens again with that item in `ctx.item` (`null` from the + menu), so it can show the item instead of the list.
- `actions` is optional: menu entries on messages (`where: "message"`, optionally only `roles: ["assistant"]`) and on sessions (`where: "session"`). Picking one opens your page with that message or session in `ctx.item` (`kind: "message"` with the text, or `kind: "session"`; add `payload: ["messages"]` to get the conversation too). Up to 8.
- `commands` is optional: slash commands for the chat box, up to 8. `/task DEMO-2` calls your `host.onResolve` handler instead of the model; return a chip to attach it, or `null` for nothing. A name the app already has is ignored.
- `tools` is optional: how your tool calls look in the chat, up to 16, no code. `match` is the tool name OpenCode reports (`mcp.tasks.*` matches every tool under that prefix); `name` and `icon` (a Remixicon name or an SVG inside the folder, like `panel.icon`) set the header, `title` and `subtitle` are templates like `{input.id}` or `{output.total} open`, and `output` picks the body: `text`, `json`, `markdown`, `code` (with `language`), or `table` (with `columns`, rows from the output array or `output.items`). Leave `output` out to keep the app's own detection.
- `capabilities` lists what needs the user's approval: `prompt` to send messages, `sessions` to create sessions and worktrees, `files` to read and write inside the open project, `model` for one-off text generation with the user's Small Model (`host.generate`, no session involved). An `integration` adds `network`, a `service` adds `service`, `filesystem` patterns (like `["~/.config/opencode/opencode.json"]`) add `filesystem`, which lets `readFile`, `writeFile`, `listDir`, and `stat` reach those paths outside the project, and a session action with `payload: ["messages"]` adds `conversation`. The user approves the whole list once at install. Calls outside it fail with `NOT_GRANTED`.
- `integration` is optional. It adds a card at Settings → Integrations. `token` takes a pasted API token (`scheme: "bearer"` for `Authorization: Bearer`, `"basic"` for a username and token pair as Jira Cloud wants), `oauth` runs an authorize flow with a pasted client id, and `host: { "provider": "linear" }` reuses the Linear account already connected in OpenChamber. The page never sees the token; OpenChamber makes the calls through `host.request`.
- `service` is optional. It declares a local process OpenChamber starts next to the extension. It runs with the user's full access and no sandbox, so declare one only when the page cannot do the job. See [GUEST_SERVICES.md](./GUEST_SERVICES.md).

## In the page

```ts
import { connectHost, HostRequestError } from '@openchamber/sdk';

const host = connectHost();

host.onReady((ctx) => {
  document.body.dataset.theme = ctx.theme.mode;
});

host.onSession((session) => {
  document.querySelector('#session')!.textContent = session?.title ?? '';
});

try {
  const user = await host.request({ method: 'GET', path: '/me' });
} catch (error) {
  if (error instanceof HostRequestError && error.code === 'DISCONNECTED') {
    await host.oauthStart();
  }
}

await host.toast({ kind: 'info', message: 'Hello' });
await host.compose({ text: 'Ask about the latest diff' });
await host.attach({
  providerId: 'acme-hello',
  id: 'TICKET-1',
  title: 'Login is broken',
  url: 'https://example.com/TICKET-1',
});
await host.startSession({
  providerId: 'acme-hello',
  id: 'TICKET-1',
  title: 'Login is broken',
  url: 'https://example.com/TICKET-1',
  worktree: true,
  text: 'Optional first message',
});
await host.prompt({ text: 'Fix the login', send: true });
await host.setBadge(3); // number on the rail icon; null clears it
const { text } = await host.generate({ prompt: task.description, system: 'One-line summary only.' }); // capability model

host.onResolve(({ command, args }) => {
  // the user typed /task DEMO-2
  const task = findTask(args.trim());
  return task ? { providerId: 'acme-hello', id: task.id, title: task.title, url: task.url } : null;
});

host.onItem((item) => {
  if (item?.kind === 'message') showMessage(item.text);      // "Create task from message"
  if (item?.kind === 'session') showSummary(item.messages);  // "Summarize session"
});
```

Every method, its limits, and the error codes are on the [Host API](https://openchamber.dev/docs/sdk/host/) page.

## UI kit

`@openchamber/sdk/ui` has buttons, fields, a searchable dropdown, checkboxes, tabs, badges, lists, empty states, spinners, banners, separators, progress bars, menus, and safe text, all drawn with the app's colours and fonts. Call `applyHostReady` from `onReady` first, then mount what you need. Every mount returns `{ update, dispose }`. Reach for the kit before writing your own controls: it follows the user's theme and keyboard habits, so the panel feels like part of the app.

```ts
import { applyHostReady, mountList } from '@openchamber/sdk/ui';

host.onReady((ctx) => {
  applyHostReady(ctx, document.documentElement);
  mountList(document.querySelector('#root')!, {
    items: tasks.map((task) => ({ id: task.id, leading: task.key, title: task.title })),
    onSelect: (id) => {
      const task = tasks.find((item) => item.id === id);
      if (task) void host.attach({ providerId: 'acme-hello', id, title: task.title, url: task.url });
    },
  });
});
```

## Schemas

`@openchamber/sdk/schemas` exports the zod schemas for the manifest and the messages, for tools that validate extensions. The main entry has no zod dependency, so a page bundle stays small.

## Scope

This package covers the page, the manifest, the messages, and the UI kit. The page gets no terminal, no git, no files outside what it declared, and no access to OpenChamber's React tree. A declared `service` is different: it is a real process with the user's rights, so it can do anything the user can, and the approval dialog says so. `apiVersion` 1 is frozen; new methods arrive with the app's releases and this package's version.
